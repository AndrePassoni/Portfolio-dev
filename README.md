## 📄 About

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project was developed to showcase my skills as a **Fullstack Developer**, my professional journey, and the projects I have been working on.

The main goal of this application is to serve as a central hub for my digital presence, offering a modern, responsive, and intuitive interface for clients and recruiters.

This project was built using core web development technologies, focusing on clean code and semantic structure:

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3**: Custom styling, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic logic.
* **Figma**: Used for UI/UX design references.

## 🎨 Features

* **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts perfectly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
* **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Advanced layouts for the "Services" and "Highlights" sections.
* **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, and dynamic elements.
* **Clean & Modern UI**: Based on a dark theme with vibrant accent colors (Red, Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow).
